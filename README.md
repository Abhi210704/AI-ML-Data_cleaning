Titanic Survival Prediction
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used is the Titanic Dataset, which contains data for 891 passengers with the following features:

PassengerId

Survived

Pclass

Name

Sex

Age

SibSp

Parch

Ticket

Fare

Cabin

Embarked

ðŸ“Š Libraries Used
pandas, numpy: Data manipulation and analysis

matplotlib, seaborn: Data visualization

sklearn: Preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation

ðŸš€ Steps Covered
Data Loading & Cleaning:

Handled missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized survival rates across different features like sex, class, age, etc.

Feature Engineering:

Encoded categorical variables and scaled numeric data.

Model Building (if done in your notebook):

Applied ML models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.

Evaluation:

Evaluated model accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.
